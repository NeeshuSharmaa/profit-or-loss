# STOCKS PROFIT OR LOSS CALCULATOR
The calculator takes 3 inputs which are the intial stocks price(i.e. bought price), quantity of stocks and current price. 
Then it outputs profit or loss (absolute & % value) accordingly. <br />

NOTE: If one presses **Check Now** without entering any of the 3 values, the calculator won't work and show an error message accordingly.
